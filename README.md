**Results and Recommendations** 

There's a chance we should explore the items visibility to see which items can be located differently to help increase profits. We also noticed that there is a good drop in items being sold from breads, hard drinks, other, startchy foods, breakfast, and seafood. We can corrilate those items with their visibility to see if those items need to be moved to help increase profits. 

We noticed that our Medium sized markets are our profit winners, as long as they are in the Tier 3 type of location. Our grocery stores are making the least amount of profit, so a slight shift of focus should be drawn to those markets to see if they are worth keeping or what can be done to increase profits. We see that our low fat contents are selling more than those with a regular fat content, offering a greatter opportuinity to continue tapping into a healthier market style with a focus on fruits and veggies, but with an opportunity to shift a slight focus on healhy items in the seafood region and breakfast items.
